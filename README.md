# Stand-Bye!

Stand-Bye! is a free tool which offers useful extra ways to put your PC in standby.  Stand-Bye can:
- prevent the sleep mode while a certain process is running
- prevent the sleep mode while your downloading something
- prevent the sleep mode while your playing games or watching a movie
- prevent the sleep mode and display timeout while you're doing a presentation


## The next generation: Econap

We have completely redesigned Stand-Bye! and renamed it "Econap". This word game is a mixture of Ecological and Powernap. Download the version here: www.econap.de

Included are more indicators if the PC is working to capacity, a more user-friendly UI and many bug fixes.

## Put your pc to sleep when it's really idle

Backup, download, synchronization: Windows computers always automatically switch to standby mode after a while, no matter whether media have been downloaded completely or the most important data saved. As a result, many users deactivate the energy saving mode and thus use more electricity than necessary.
Stand-Bye! puts your pc to sleep when it's REALLY idle!

This puts an end to tedious waiting at the computer. Moreover, the free open source software protects the environment, the wallet, and the user's nerves.
