# Stand-Bye!

Stand-Bye! is a free tool which offers useful extra ways to put your PC in standby.

## Put your pc to sleep when it's really idle

Backup, download, synchronization: Windows computers always automatically switch to standby mode after a while, no matter whether media have been downloaded completely or the most important data saved. As a result, many users deactivate the energy saving mode and thus use more electricity than necessary.
Stand-Bye! puts your pc to sleep when it's REALLY idle!

This puts an end to tedious waiting at the computer. Moreover, the free open source software protects the environment, the wallet, and the user's nerves.

## Stand-Bye! 1.0 (in development)

We have developed a lot on Stand-Bye! in the last two years. In fact it has been completly rewritten in C# with WPF. However the next big release won't be opensource anymore. **BUT IT WILL REMAIN FREE IN THE BASE VERSION**.

We included lots of new features that will get a **PLUS VERSION** of Stand-Bye!. Our **Beta-Newsletter** subscribers will get the first preview of the new version.
